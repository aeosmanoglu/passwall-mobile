## Hello Contributers

1. Don't send too much commit at once. It will be easier for us to do a code review.

1. Be sure to take a look at the second branch. The version I am working on is there.

1. First try to fix `//TODO:`s in the code.

1. Then you can contribute to the development by following the "Passwall Mobile Board in the Projects.

1. Don't mess with the user interface. The design guide has not been released yet.

> If you want to connect to the localhost server with the Android emulator, you need to write `http://10.0.2.2:3625` or you can use our demo server: [https://passwall-server.herokuapp.com](https://passwall-server.herokuapp.com).
