> For help getting started with Flutter, view their [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Hello Contributers

1. Don't send too much commit at once. It will be easier for us to do a code review.

1. Be sure to take a look at the second branch. The version I am working on is there.

1. First try to fix `//TODO:`s in the code.

1. Then you can contribute to the development by following the mile stones.

1. Don't mess with the user interface. The design guide has not been released yet.

> When you want to connect to the localhost server with the Android emulator, you connect to the emulator's localhost server and you get an error. Instead, try connecting to the [Heroku Demo server](https://passwall-server.herokuapp.com).
